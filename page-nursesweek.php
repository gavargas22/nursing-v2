								<h2>In the 21st century, health care organizations must effectively identify, nurture, and prepare the next generation of high-performance leaders to sustain high-quality patient care in a fast-changing environment.</h2>

                                	To assist our region’s health care organizations in meeting this challenge, UTEP’s School of Nursing is launching The Nursing and
                                	Health Care Leadership Institute (NHCLI) designed for the emerging health care leader who will help their organization navigate 
                                	through tomorrow's pragmatic and administrative challenges. The NHCLI consists of a set of strategically crafted training options 
                                	(e.g., Master’s program, post-graduate certifications, conferences, and continuous education seminars and workshops) to strengthen 
                                	the analytical tools, management acumen, and interpersonal skills of participants from inter-professional backgrounds working in 
                                	health care organizations. Specifically, the NHCLI aims at preparing health care managers to build effective teams, resolve strategic 
                                	problems, drive change through the organization, and ultimately get to the next level of patient care via a comprehensive understanding 
                                	of complex systems, organizational theory, financial management and hands-on leadership practice.<br>

									<br>The School of Nursing, as part of the University of Texas at El Paso’s Centennial Celebration, will host a kick-off 
									conference during Nurses Week 2014 to introduce the NHCLI program to our region’s health care community. The conference 
									will bring together regional, national, and international health care professionals to discuss the opportunities and challenges 
									nurses and other health care professionals face in today’s turbulent environment. The conference experience will also include a 
									set of seminars on selected leadership topics that are highly relevant to our regional health care community as well as a closing 
									cocktail.
